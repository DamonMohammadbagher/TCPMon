# TCPMon
TCPMon v3.1 or (4.0) was a very old Code which made by me in C# for Monitoring TCP Connection via Native APIs (was fun in that time ;D)

special thanks to "stackoverflow" guys for help me to work with APIs & ... , this was really fun also useful for me in that time! 

Tested on VS.NET 2008 + (WinXP, 2003 Server & Win7). 

Note: with/without "rus as Admin", you can use this code ;)
